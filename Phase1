Ideas:
1. Social media marketing/ influencer culture: Analyzing data and making price comparisons of influencers with varying levels of popularity and their rates of sponsorships/pay-per-post/ brand advertisement.
2. Global price/financial trend of condoms. Ultimately with the data analyzed, we hope to make an argument regarding its cause. 
3. Trends of reproduction rates and the surrounding causes behind their changes 
4. Growing alcohol culture in universities and colleges and cases of alcohol poisoning on campus. Utilizing surveys of students reporting how many drinks they have per week. 

Questions for Reviewers:
1. Do these ideas work? We are confused on how specific or how broad these ideas need to be. 
2. If we were to collect our own data, how would that work? Would we have to create and collect survey responses?
3. What exactly does the modeling portion of this project entail?
