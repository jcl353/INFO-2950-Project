    "# Introduction \n",
    "\n",
    "The fertility rate in all, if not most countries is susceptible to fluctuation over period of time. Whether that may be due to a singular factor or a result of intricate relationships of multiple factors, we are intrigued to possibly compare and identify different factors that might play a significant role in the fluctuation of fertility rate across differnt countries. We have collected publicly available data with statistics on fertility rate of OECD (The Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development) in the last decade along with other notable statistics about those countries such as GDP, Health Spending, Employment Rate, Adult Education Level, and Internet Access. We are analzying this data to identify patterns in the possible relationships these attributes might have on the fertility rate across different countries over time. \n",
    "\n",
    "Fertility rate in a specific year is described as the total number of children that would be born to each woman given that she is able to live to the end of her child-bearing years and give birth to children in correspondence to the age-specific fertility rates. A total fertility rate of 2.1 children per woman ensures a broadly stable population assuming that there is an equilibrium in net migration and mortality. Together with mortality and migration, fertility rate reflects the effects of multifaceted development of a country, whether that may be economical, social, and/or more.  "

    "Much of the data that is available is multi-faceted. Meaning,the data observed and recorded was most likely influenced by whether the data set provides an insight on the degree of development of countries over time.

Although the missing values have been replaced with NaN, the missing values certainly detract from true comparison among countries. In fact, in the dataset for internet access, data for Japan was not included. While the data could have been retrieved from different organization, the data wasn't used due to the fact that the method of data collecting might be inconsistent with that of OECD. \n",

    "<br>\n",
    "\n",
    "- Similarly, the datas that have been collected are limited to countries that are a part of OECD, Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development. These countries are relatively more developed than the countries that are not part of the organization. For this reason, the countries can exhibit trends that are too similar of one another. While this might not exactly be a limitation, it can limit the amount of retrievable information from data anlysis. "
